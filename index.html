        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly efficient and suitable for building scalable network applications. Node.js is commonly used to run backend servers and handle API requests in MERN stack applications.
